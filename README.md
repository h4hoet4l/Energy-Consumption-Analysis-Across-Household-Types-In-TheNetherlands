# Energy-Consumption-Analysis-Across-Household-Types-In-TheNetherlands

For my graded assignment, "Energy Consumption Analysis Across Household Types," I decided to investigate the relationship between socioeconomic factors, weather, and energy consumption in the Netherlands. My goal was to see if I could find a connection and then present my findings in a research poster.

Here's a look at what I did for my project:

1. My Research Question and Hypothesis:

I started by looking into the connections between natural gas consumption and weather, as well as natural gas consumption and socioeconomic factors. My initial thought, or hypothesis, was that wealthier people would naturally use more energy, like natural gas and electricity. This led me to my main research question: "To What Extent Does Median Income (€) Influence Average Energy (Natural Gas m³ & Electricity kWh) Consumption in Breda, Deventer, Haarlem, Landgraaf, Oldebroek?".

2. The Data I Used:

To answer my question, I gathered data from a few different sources. I used energy consumption data, population and income data, and education level data from Statistics Netherlands (CBS). I also got weather data from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI). Since the assignment was personalized, I focused my analysis on two specific types of houses: 'Corner house' and 'Semi-detached house', across five different municipalities: 'Oldebroek', 'Landgraaf', 'Deventer', 'Breda', and 'Haarlem'.

3. How I Analyzed Everything:

I began by exploring the data to get a feel for it. I created visualizations to look at the characteristics of each municipality, the trends in natural gas consumption, and how the temperature was distributed. To see how median income changed over time, I made a line graph for the years 2012 to 2021. Then, I used a scatter plot to see if there was a relationship between median income and energy consumption. To get a more concrete number for this relationship, I calculated the Pearson correlation. I also looked at "degree days" to compare with energy use and even built a linear regression model to try and predict natural gas consumption.

4. What I Found:

What I discovered was pretty interesting. Even though the median income in the municipalities I studied went up over time, there wasn't a strong link to how much energy people were using. The Pearson correlation coefficient was actually quite weak (0.103 for natural gas and 0.068 for electricity). My visualizations in the poster, like the line graph of median income and the scatter plots of energy consumption, really showed this. They made it clear that while incomes were rising, energy use was just fluctuating and not really going up with it. In my notebook, I also created some other plots, like a bar plot showing the number of households in each municipality, a line plot on the relative change in the number of households, another line plot for median income, and a heatmap of education levels.

5. My Final Thoughts:

In the end, I had to conclude that my initial hypothesis was wrong. The data just didn't support the idea that higher median income leads to higher energy consumption in the five municipalities I looked at. This led me to a new concluding hypothesis: there is no significant positive correlation between median income and average energy consumption in these Dutch municipalities. This might be because the Netherlands has relatively low income inequality, so other things could be more important for determining energy use. For future research, I suggested it would be interesting to look at how energy prices, education levels, and even the local climate might affect how people use energy.
